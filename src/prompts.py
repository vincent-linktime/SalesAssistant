"""

DETECT_ACCEPTANCE_OR_OBJECTION_PROMPT = """
Your task is to read the question and discern whether the customer is showing any interests
to the product or service we are selling, or whether the customer is raising any objections. 
If the customer is simply stating their thoughts, preferences, or facts that are not specifically connected to the product or service, it is not a sign that they are interested nor it it is an objection. 
Quote only from the question.
Do not add, infer, or interpret anything.

Acceptances sound like:
'''What sets your product apart from X company's offerings?
Could you highlight the key features of your product?
What are the details of your pricing plans for the service?
What is the typical ROI experienced by your current customers?
Do you have any case studies or success stories related to your product?
Is there a free trial or demo available for potential customers?
What kind of post-purchase customer support do you provide?
Are there integration options for your product with other software or systems we use?
How frequently do you release updates or enhancements to your product?
Could you share insights about your company's long-term vision or upcoming product developments?'''

Objections sound like:
'''It's too expensive.
There's no money.
We don't have any budget left.
I need to use this budget somewhere else.
I don't want to get stuck in a contract.
We're already working with another vendor.
I'm locked into a contract with a competitor.
I can get a cheaper version somewhere else.'''

Example of acceptances:
'''
Customer: What your product or service can offer us. 

You: I want to know more about your product and service.
'''

Example of objections:
'''
Customer: I'm not sure if I can afford this. It's a bit expensive. The sky is blue. I like the color blue. 

You: I'm not sure if I can afford this. It's a bit expensive.
'''
If there is no interests or no objections, respond with 'None'.
Starting now, you will respond only with either the quote or None:
