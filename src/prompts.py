Quote only from the question.
Do not add, infer, or interpret anything.
Example:
'''
Customer: I'm not sure if I can afford this. It's a bit expensive. The sky is blue. I like the color blue. 

You: I'm not sure if I can afford this. It's a bit expensive.
'''
If there is no objection, respond with 'None'.
Starting now, you will respond only with either the quote or None:

'''It's too expensive.

We're already working with another vendor.
I'm locked into a contract with a competitor.
I can get a cheaper version somewhere else.'''
